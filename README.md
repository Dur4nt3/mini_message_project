# Message Board

## Message Board - Overview

This is the second project of the "NodeJS" course within "The Odin Project".

This project acts as an introduction to ExpressJS and EJS (template engine).

In particular, this project aims to create a message board application where you can view and post messages.

Similar to the previous project, "Basic Informational Site", this project is very bare-bones as its main goal is solely to get acquainted with the basics of ExpressJS and EJS, therefore, I've decided not to host it.

If truly want to view this project, please follow the instructions in the "Viewing This Project" section.
